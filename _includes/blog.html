I thought it was clever at the time - now I deeply regret even thinking of that pun. Regardless, I took up blogging to share my recent work and design tips with anybody that may wish to see it. It's kept pretty up-to-date, as are the other sections of the site, but if you enjoy reading my light-hearted rambles for some reason, that's the place for you to go.</p></div></div></section>
