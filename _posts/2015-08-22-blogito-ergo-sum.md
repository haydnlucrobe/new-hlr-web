description: The first ramble of many to come, hopefully. I explain what I want from the blog, why I've taken it up, my regret over the post title, and which Harry Potter house I would consider myself to be in. See why I call them rambles?

<h3 class="para-header">I never really understood blogging...</h3>

I mean, I know it's all the rage, and about half of the internet uses around it of late, but with me it's never really caught on until now\. To be honest *I don't know why I've taken to it*, but I have, and have almost found solace in typing out my thoughts for people to openly read\. This is mainly the reason for the extremely cheesy title of this post, for which I apologise profusely to Ren√© Descartes (the quote of whom has been "cleverly" adapted by myself and many others to be relevant to blogging)\. I have committed this crime to humanity, however, because I truly believe that I have found a new sense of peace in blogging, one that can't quite be replicated by writing a diary or talking to a confidante\. Something about making this information public gives it all a distinctly different vibe \- and I like it\.

<h3 class="para-header">But more to the point at hand...</h3>

Which to me is very much *"Why are you writing a blog, Haydn?"*\. Well, very good question italicised me \- 10 points to Ravenclaw\*\. The reason is that I felt like I should take up blogging, to give easy access of my recent work, or tips in website and magazine design, to whoever may need or want it\. Despite this post being pretty laid\-back and generally off\-topic, my idea for this is to give more a professional theme to the blog in general (though I will still write posts much like this one, I imagine, lest I take myself too seriously)\.

<h3 class="para-header">To sum up, though...</h3>

If you would rather not trawl through my very latest work and tips, and would prefer to just peruse through my websites/magazines on you own accord, (or if you don't want to suffer through any more of my ramblings,) [the homepage of my website](/) is definitely the best place for you to go\. I keep the other pages *just* as up\-to\-date as this blog, so you'll find everything there which you would here, and vice\-versa\.

**That's it for this post though, so thanks for reading\.**

<h3 class="post-goodbye">Haydn, out.</h3>

<p class="post-footnote">*If I were a Harry Potter character, I definitely would consider myself to be a Ravenclaw. The more you know.</h3>
